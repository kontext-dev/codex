## Kontext-Dev fork

This fork wires Codex CLI to the Kontext-Dev MCP server using the `kontext-dev`
Rust SDK. It uses a single MCP server and refreshes SEARCH/EXECUTE tools before
each user turn. The diff stays minimal so upstream updates are easy to rebase.

### Configuration (local)

Create agents at https://app.kontext.dev/ to get client credentials and
visibility into your agents (like this Codex client). Then copy the credentials
into `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[kontext-dev]
mcp_url = "http://localhost:4000/mcp"
token_url = "http://127.0.0.1:4444/oauth2/token"
client_id = "<client_id>"
client_secret = "<client_secret>"
scope = "mcp:invoke"
server_name = "kontext-dev"
```

Do not commit secrets.

Default branch: `kontext-dev`. `main` mirrors `openai/codex`, and `kontext-dev`
is rebased onto `main` to stay current.

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

<details>
<summary>You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest">latest GitHub Release</a> and download the appropriate binary for your platform.</summary>

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.
